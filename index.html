                Here I will tell you about CHEESE.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Archaeological evidence for making cheese in Egypt goes back about 5,000 years.
                In 2018, archeologists from Cairo University and the University of Catania reported the discovery of the oldest known cheese from Egypt. Discovered in the Saqqara necropolis, it is around 3200 years old.
                <br>Cheese is quite an ancient snack!

                So, how to make CHEESE? Well, I found a step by step guide for you (these are just basics of making cheese): 
                </p>
                <p>
                
                <p>
                Step 1: Get some warm milk<br>Cheese is made out of milk so you gotta have some of it.

                <p>
                    Step 2: Acidify the milk<br>You can add vinegar or citric acid which make ricotta and mascarpone, you may also add some cultures or living bacteria for acidity and then let it sit for a while to make different cheese, different levels of acidity make different cheese if I am correct.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 3: Add a cougalant (sometimes you don't have to)<br>Rennet is the most popular one, but which kind of rennet is not really certain. There are a lot of different cougalants for different results, you can google "cougalants for cheese", I am just telling the basics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Step 4: Huh?<br>Well, now it just splits into a ton of ways to make cheese from here, get creative! (just don't poison yourself in the process)<br>(I also left a video tutorial at the very bottom, it is a bit boring but please watch it, it is one of the icons)<br>
